					<h3>Welcome To Our Website!</h3>
					<p>As you may have noticed, this is the official website for Katherine Forrest Registered Childminder, a childminder based in the Lancaster area. The basic structure, or skeleton, is all in place, but that is all. This is very much a work-in-progress website, but it is the first step towards the future.</p>

					<p>On here, there are links to <img src="images/babydayslogo.png" alt="Baby's Days" width=75px height=25px>, where you can see what your child has done today, contact details for Katherine, useful information for parents, and information about the week ahead.</p>
